I started my journey of creating my website by learning the basics of HTML and exploring various styles that I could incorporate into my design. To gather inspiration, I spent time searching the internet and watching videos on HTML and CSS. With the help of these resources, I was able to implement CSS ideas and styles to make my website look modern and unique.

However, my first mockup design wasn't up to my standards, so I made multiple tweaks until I was satisfied with the look. I also learned how to stylize fonts and incorporate images into my website to give it a cohesive theme.

With the design in place, I then wrote my own bio and included all the necessary information to make my website informative and engaging for visitors. I linked my website to my Gmail account and a regular news site to increase its reach and connectivity.

Overall, I took a dedicated approach to creating my website, starting from the basics and building up to a polished and professional final product
