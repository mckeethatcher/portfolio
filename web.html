            <p>Growing up in Southern California near the famous Coachella music festival, music has always been a significant part of McKee's life. From a young age, McKee has been surrounded by the sounds of different genres and has developed a true passion for music. McKee has always been drawn to the art of expression and the way music can bring people together. Along with music, McKee has always had a fascination with learning new languages. Whether it be through classes, language exchange programs, or simply speaking with native speakers, McKee has made it a hobby to expand McKee's linguistic abilities. This combination of interests has shaped McKee into a well-rounded individual who is always seeking new experiences and ways to grow.</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is McKee. I have a passion for technology and have spent years learning to code in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. My love for coding started when I realized the limitless possibilities it offers in designing and creating beautiful and functional websites. I have honed my skills and I am now capable of creating dynamic and responsive websites that provide an optimal user experience.

              Aside from my technical skills, I have also had a rich and diverse professional background. I spent several years living in Japan, where I worked as a translator. This experience allowed me to immerse myself in the language and culture, and it gave me a deep appreciation for the value of clear and effective communication.
              
              More recently, I have worked as a training supervisor for new employees at Vivint, a leading provider of smart home technology. In this role, I was responsible for ensuring that new employees received the training and support they needed to succeed in their new positions. I was able to use my communication skills and technical expertise to help others, and I found this work to be extremely fulfilling.
              
              Overall, I am a well-rounded individual who brings a unique combination of technical and interpersonal skills to the table. I am eager to use my abilities to contribute to new and exciting projects and to continue learning and growing in my career.</p>
